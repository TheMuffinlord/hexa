# hexa (extremely working title)

i'm going to make a hexagon turn-based tactics game. i've just made the repo public to keep me honest, i guess. when i start putting it together in a "fun" way i will probably private the hell out of this and throw it up on itch.

i'm learning as i go, and the code in here is somewwhere beyond spaghetti right now. I hate throwing things out if they could be useful, so expect some wild comments.

### muffin i want to see how it works!

you'll need to clone this repo. I run this in WSL because I'm a brain genius but if you have git and python, `git clone https://github.com/TheMuffinlord/hexa.git` should do it, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the version of pygame. `python3 -m main.py` to run, but expect it to be messy while i work.

significant portions of my hexagon handling code are taken from red blob games's amazingly comprehensive guide on the matter. [you can find it here](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/).

muffinlord wrote all the code, as if anyone else would claim it. some portions may be salvaged from other projects i have built, and some i definitely cut and paste from websites. no large language models were used in the making of this project.
