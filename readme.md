working on a thing. if this gets to be a huge thing i will probably take it down.

installation
fuckin clone this or something idk

you'll probably need pygame installed to run it. i guess run pip install -r requirements.txt before you try running this.

usage

you can use this, pretty much all the good parts of this are taken from other projects. i will never run my shit through copilot though
